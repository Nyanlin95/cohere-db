## Agent Awareness Dashboard Auto-Refresh Fix

### Task Executed
**Task:** "add auto refresh to dashboard. I can't see the change when I move the cards to different column. dashboard should response the momonet I drag and drop."

### Root Cause
The `refreshDashboard()` function was being called without the `renderFull=true` parameter after card operations (drag/drop, add, edit, delete). This meant only card counts were updated, not the actual card positions on the board.

### Changes Made
Fixed 4 locations in `dashboard.html`:
1. **Line ~1058** - After adding a card → `refreshDashboard(true)`
2. **Line ~1079** - After drag/drop move → `refreshDashboard(true)`
3. **Line ~1131** - After editing a card → `refreshDashboard(true)`
4. **Line ~1163** - After deleting a card → `refreshDashboard(true)`

### Result
Dashboard now immediately reflects changes when:
- Cards are dragged to different columns
- Cards are added/edited/deleted
- Visual feedback is instant

### Task Promotion
- Promoted 2 tasks from Ideas to Next to Active
- Task 1: Auto-refresh fix (COMPLETED)
- Task 2: "make this dashboard deployable" (still in Active)

### Dashboard Status
- Total Tasks: 19
- Completed: 15
